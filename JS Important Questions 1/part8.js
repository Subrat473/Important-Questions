// Objects in JavaScript


// In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. It is a way to group related data and functionality together, making it easy to access and manage. Objects can store properties (data) and methods (functions), allowing you to represent complex structures.


// Keys are also called properties, and they are usually strings or symbols.

// Values can be anything, including numbers, strings, arrays, functions, or even other objects.

// var obj = {
//     name: "harsh",
//     age: 24,
//     gawaarhai: false,
// };


// Object.freeze(obj);
// delete obj.name;
