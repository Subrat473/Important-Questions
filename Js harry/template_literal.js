// emplate literals in JavaScript are string literals that allow embedded expressions, multi-line strings, and string interpolation. They are enclosed by backtick (`) characters and use the ${...} syntax to include variables or expressions directly within the string




let num1 = 4
let num2 = 7

let result = num1 + num2

console.log(`The addition of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${result}`);
