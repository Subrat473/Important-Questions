// Difference Between Smart and Dumb Components: Smart components have state and logic, can communicate with other components through props and callbacks, and can make API calls or perform complex logic. Typically, they are class-based components. On the other hand, dumb components have no state or logic, can only receive props and emit events, and can only display data passed to them. They are usually functional components.
// Stateful vs Stateless Components: Stateful components manage their own state and can trigger re-renders when their state changes. Stateless components, also known as functional components, do not have their own state and rely on props passed from parent components to render their UI.
// Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components: Controlled components take in the current values through props and then notify the changes via callbacks. Uncontrolled components, however, use refs to get their current values directly from the DOM.
// Class Components vs Functional Components: Class components can have local state and lifecycle methods, while functional components cannot have local state or lifecycle methods until React 16.8 introduced hooks. Functional components are simpler, easier to understand and test, and have better performance than class components.
// Static vs Dynamic Components: Static components are defined with a fixed set of properties or attributes and do not change during their lifecycle. Dynamic components, on the other hand, can change their properties, state, or behavior based on user interactions or events within the application.
// Renderless Components: Renderless components do not render any HTML elements to the DOM but expose data and methods to other components through props and callbacks. This approach helps in separating logic and presentation concerns, making the code easier to maintain and test.
// Error Boundaries: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI rather than crashing the whole application.
// Context in React: Context is a way to share data that is considered "global" for a component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It can be particularly useful for sharing data such as user authentication status, theme settings, or locale preferences.
// Higher-Order Components (HOCs): HOCs are a pattern that involves wrapping a component in another component to reuse code for rendering logic. They are useful for abstracting component logic, such as adding authentication checks or logging.
// Lifecycle Methods: Lifecycle methods in class components allow you to run code at specific times during a component's lifetime, such as when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts. With the introduction of hooks, many lifecycle methods are now less commonly used.
// Form Handling: Forms in React can be handled using controlled components, where the form inputs' values are controlled by the component's state, or uncontrolled components, where the form inputs' values are controlled by the DOM. Using third-party libraries like Formik or the new hooks in React, such as useState and useEffect, can make form handling more efficient.
